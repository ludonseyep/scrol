    <h2><span>Letter Home by Childish Gambino Lyrics</span></h2>
    <p>
        <span>[Verse]</span>
        <br>
        <span>You're the only girl that I have ever wanted</span>
        <br>
        <span>Every other girl is trying to be you</span>
        <br>
        <span>My mama says that I should write you letters</span>
        <br>
        <span>But I think you're with other dudes</span>
        <br>
        <span>Take my hand, you'll like it</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>You don't even have to call</span>
        <br>
        <span>Yes I've had some alcohol, I'm sorry</span>
        <br>
        <span>Take my hand</span>
        <br>
        <span>You don't even have to call</span>
        <br>
        <span>You're somewhere out there after all</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>[Outro]</span>
        <br>
        <span>You're all I ever wanted</span>
        <br>
        <span>You're all I ever wanted</span>
        <br>
        <span>You're all I ever wanted</span>
        <br>
